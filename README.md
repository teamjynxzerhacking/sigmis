# Sigmis

**Sigmis** is an open-source **educational security simulation tool** written as a Windows batch script.

The project is designed for **learning purposes only**, demonstrating concepts such as:
- access control simulation
- integrity checks
- basic command-line security flows

Some advanced features are intentionally restricted and require a **whitelist key**.  
This is part of the simulation and **does not perform any real hacking or exploitation**.
